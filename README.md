# Pipelines for running on CFIN servers

The closest thing we have to a "recommended analysis strategy". Contributions should be 

* generic enough to be transferrable to other datasets; ideally simply by replacing the name of an input file.
* limited in scope: prefer a Lego-block like approach, rather than a single monolithic recipe.
* well-documented, both in the code and on the [wik](http://wiki.pet.auh.dk/wiki)

If the processing pipeline you would like to contribut does not yet exist, create a new folder with a _descriptive_ name and place your code there.
